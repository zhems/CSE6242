 1. Ease to develop
        R: Fastest, quick and dirty done in 5-6 lines of code, unless using Shiny library to build interactive visualisations that users can interact with

        Tableau: Relatively fast
        D3: Most tedious and troublesome
2. Ease to maintain the visualization
        R: Easy if simple visualisation, trouble if using Shiny library

        Tableau: Relatively easy
        D3: Most troublesome to maintain
3. Usability of visualization
        R: Static and non-interactive, unless using Shiny library

        Tableau: Slightly interactive
        D3: Can be very usable and interactive
4. Scalability of visualization to “large” datasets
        R: Yes

        Tableau: Yes
        D3: Yes
5. System requirements to run the visualization
        R: None

        Tableau: None
        D3: Browsers
